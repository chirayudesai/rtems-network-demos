This directory contains an RTEMS application for measuring TCP/UDP
network throughput.   The ttcp_orig subdirectory contains the original
UNIX program which can be compiled and run on your host machine.

The RTEMS version of the test program is a little clumsy to use.  You
have to edit the rtems_ttcp.c source file and change the ttcp_argv
array of strings to set the arguments you want passed to the ttcp
task.

It does work, though.  The best throughputs I've seen so far are:
	68360 card can transmit a TCP stream at 198 kbytes/second.
	68360 card can receive a TCP stream at 119 kbytes/second.
In both cases, the other end of the transfer was a 486DX2/66 running
OPENSTEP/MACH 4.1.  

One noteworthy item is that I was able to get the UNIX test program
running under RTEMS with no changes to the test program itself.  The
entire UNIX source file is included, without changes, into the RTEMS
source file.
