This is a very preliminary version of the RTEMS OS Web Monitoring
package (oswebmon).  It is currently in git to encourage team
development.  It was conceived and initially implemented by
Thomas Doerfler using the GoAhead webserver.  Thomas never got
time to finish this and has graciously opened the code.

It does not currently support many object types and the
basic htmlprintf() framework appears to have broken either by 
bitrot or the transition to the Simple HTTPD server.

Warnings about the conversion and update:

+ Simple HTTPD does NOT have the same type of argument parsing
  as GoAhead did.  The html argument parsing is new for Simple HTTPD.

+ Simple HTTPD has been renamed to Mongoose HTTPD, the code should
  be adapted for that.

There is one serious bug and a number of open issues to address:

+ BUG: Thomas implemented an htmlprintf() to do some string
  processing.  The substitution does NOT appear to be happening.

+ Thomas has a fairly significant patch that adds support for more
  managers to the monitor.  The use of this functionality is currently
  disabled in the osmonweb code.

+ The "preprocessing" to switch between GoAhead and SHTTPD references
  in the html is a hack which will need to be addressed when this
  code is merged into RTEMS properly.

+ There are C files with html in strings.  These files appear to be
  the output of some type of processor.  Joel didn't understand this
  part of the processing and ignored it. Thomas will have to tell us
  what magic is missing.

+ Thomas' source had an html/templates directory that I don't know
  what to do with.
