Debugging Hints
===============
For debugging, I'd suggest breakpoints in the socket receive and transmit  
tasks to trace where you're running.  Also, if you have a LANalyzer or  
workstation with `snoop' capability set it up to show all packets to/from the  
hardware (Ethernet) address of your target machine.
