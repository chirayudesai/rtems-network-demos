Debugging Hints
===============
If you also define TRACE_NETWORK_DRIVER you'll get a *lot*
of printout describing each packet as  it passes through the stack.

For debugging, I'd suggest breakpoints in the socket receive and transmit  
tasks to trace where you're running.  Also, if you have a LANalyzer or  
workstation with `snoop' capability set it up to show all packets to/from the  
hardware (Ethernet) address of your target machine.
