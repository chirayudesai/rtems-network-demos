A simple application to test some of the KA9Q networking code.

    **************************
    *          NOTES         *
    **************************

1. Make sure you change the definition of MY_ETHERNET_ADDRESS in init.c
   before you try to use this program.

2. If you do not use BOOTP (i.e. the `#define USE_BOOTP 1' in init.c is
   removed), make sure you change the definition of MY_INTERNET_ADDRESS
   before you try to use the program.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS MAY PROVOKE YOUR NETWORK
ADMINISTRATOR TO THE POINT WHERE VICIOUS ATTACKS WILL BE MADE UPON YOU.

3. Once this program is running on the target machine, you can test
   the network code by:
	a) Typing commands at the target console:
		s - show network statistics
		t - transmit TCP packets
		u - transmit UDP packets
	b) Run `telnet target_machine 24742' on another machines.
	   Everything you type should be echoed back and noted on
	   the target console.
	   You can run more than one telnet session at once.
	   You can use port number 24743 as well.
